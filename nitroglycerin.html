        <p>
          Nitroglycerin was popularized by Alfred Nobel, who
          used it to manufacture dynamite. Shortly thereafter,
          factory workers began noticing strange symptoms whose
          timing seemed suspicious. Some workers experienced
          headaches during the work week that resolved over
          the weekend, while other workers (with a history
          of angina pectoris) noticed that their symptoms
          resolved during the week, only to return on the
          weekend.
          <br>
          <br>
          This led to the investigation of nitroglycerin as
          an anti-anginal medication, and it's still in
          wide use today as the first-line treatment for
          angina pectoris.

        <h3>Mechanism of Action</h3>

        <p>
          Nitroglycerin's primary mechanism of action is to
          cause vasodilation. This creates a decrease in systemic
          vascular resistance (afterload) and hopefully increases
          blood flow and oxygenation through obstructed or
          constricted coronary arteries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although nitroglycerin has been in use for nearly
          150 years, its exact mechanism of action wasn't
          fully explained until 1998. Physicians and physiologists
          thought it obvious that nitroglycerin caused
          vasodilation, but could not determine the specific
          pathway until 1998. Increasing evidence had shown
          nitric oxide (NO) to be released by vascular smooth
          muscle at a more rapid rate when in the presence
          of nitroglycerin.
        </p>

          In fact, the Nobel Prize for
          <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1998/press.html">Medicine and Physiology that year</a>
          was awarded
          to Furchgott, Ignarro and Murad for their discovery
          of Nitric Oxide's role in mediating vasodilation.
          They published their results in a paper titled
          <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10598133">
            "Nitric Oxide as a signaling molecule in the vascular system: an overview"</a>.

            Severely hypoxic patients may take longer to
            respond to naloxone than usual. Since this is
            impossible to determine beforehand, it is important
            to support ventilation with a BVM attached to
            high-flow oxygen.
            <br><br>
            Proactive airway management is necessary due
            to the risk of vomiting post-administration.
            Since it's possible that the patient has taken
            other drugs that will not be affected by naloxone,
            it can't be assumed that the patient will be able
            to adequately protect their own airway.
            <br><br>
            While these patients rarely require intubation,
            it is not uncommon to place
            supraglottic/extraglottic airways (e.g., King LTD,
            Combitube) is sometimes required.

            Opiates generally cause vasodilation and a
            decrease in blood pressure, causing a compensetory
            increase in heart rate. The reversal of these
            effects can compromise hemodynamic stability.
            Common side-effects include hypertension,
            hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia.
