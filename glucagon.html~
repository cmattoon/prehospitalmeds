        <p>
          Naloxone is a
          <em data-def="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_antagonist">competitive &mu;-opioid antagonist</em>
          that is indicated for acute opioid overdose.
          Since it posesses almost no agonist properties,
          it has no significant side effects if
          administered to a patient who has not taken opioids.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to it's low-risk, high-benefit nature, naloxone
          is becoming increasingly available to the public via
          <a href="http://harmreduction.org/about-us/principles-of-harm-reduction/">harm-reduction advocacy groups</a>
          and
          <a href="http://lawatlas.org/query?dataset=laws-regulating-administration-of-naloxone">changing legislation</a>.
          Despite its relative safety and ease of administration,
          careless administration of naloxone can lead to
          complications down the road.
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
          In its parenteral form, naloxone is
          commonly administered via the intravenous (IV)
          or intranasal (IN) routes. Of these, IN is generally
          preferred, as it carries fewer risks to both the
          provider and patient.

        <h3>Mechanism of Action</h3>
        <p>
          Naloxone binds to the body's &mu;-opioid receptors
          with a higher affinity than do most opiates.
          This causes naloxone to "replace" the
          <em>opioid agonist</em>
          (e.g., morphine, heroin) with an "inactive"
          naloxone molecule. Since the receptors are no
          longer being stimulated, the body begins functioning
          normally again.

        <h3>Routes of Administration</h3>

        <h4>Intranasal (IN)</h4>
        <p>
          This route has similar absorption properties to
          other parenteral routes like IV and IM. This route
          is generally preferred in the prehospital environment
          for its safety (no needles) and ease of use, but
          requires a special device called an <em>atomizer</em>
          to create a fine mist.
        </p>

        <h4>Intravenous (IV)/Intraosseous (IO)</h4>
        <p>
          These routes are equivalent in terms of time to
          onset. However, the additional time required to
          initiate access may contribute to a longer downtime.
          <em>In Pennsylvania, AEMTs are not permitted to
            administer naloxone via the IV route</em>
        </p>

        <h4>Intramuscular (IM)/Subcutaneous (SC)</h4>
        <p>
          This route is somewhat slower than the IV route,
          but is an option if no MAD device is available.
          The IM route has a slightly faster absorption rate
          and should generally be preferred in the prehospital
          setting.
        </p>

        <h4>Endotracheal (ET)</h4>
        <p>
          Naloxone is one of several medications that could
          traditionally be administered via the ET route.
          With the availability of the MAD device, this route
          is largely obsolete for our purposes.

        <h3>Monitoring</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>Airway/Breathing</dt>
          <dd>
            Severely hypoxic patients may take longer to
            respond to naloxone than usual. Since this is
            impossible to determine beforehand, it is important
            to support ventilation with a BVM attached to
            high-flow oxygen.
            <br><br>
            Proactive airway management is necessary due
            to the risk of vomiting post-administration.
            Since it's possible that the patient has taken
            other drugs that will not be affected by naloxone,
            it can't be assumed that the patient will be able
            to adequately protect their own airway.
            <br><br>
            While these patients rarely require intubation,
            it is not uncommon to place
            supraglottic/extraglottic airways (e.g., King LTD,
            Combitube) is sometimes required.
          </dd>

          <dt>Cardiovascular</dt>
          <dd>
            Opiates generally cause vasodilation and a
            decrease in blood pressure, causing a compensetory
            increase in heart rate. The reversal of these
            effects can compromise hemodynamic stability.
            Common side-effects include hypertension,
            hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia.
          </dd>

          <dt>Gastrointestinal</dt>
          <dd>
            Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are common side
            effects of naloxone.
