          Naloxone is a
          <em data-def="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_antagonist">competitive &mu;-opioid antagonist</em>
          that is indicated for acute opioid overdose.
          Since it posesses almost no agonist properties,
          it has no significant side effects if
          administered to a patient who has not taken opioids.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to it's low-risk, high-benefit nature, naloxone
          is becoming increasingly available to the public via
          <a href="http://harmreduction.org/about-us/principles-of-harm-reduction/">harm-reduction advocacy groups</a>
          and
          <a href="http://lawatlas.org/query?dataset=laws-regulating-administration-of-naloxone">changing legislation</a>.
          Despite its relative safety and ease of administration,
          careless administration of naloxone can lead to
          complications down the road.

          In its parenteral form, naloxone is
          commonly administered via the intravenous (IV)
          or intranasal (IN) routes. Of these, IN is generally
          preferred, as it carries fewer risks to both the
          provider and patient.

          Naloxone binds to the body's &mu;-opioid receptors
          with a higher affinity than do most opiates. This
          causes naloxone to replace the
          The &mu;-opioid receptors are one of several types
          of opioid receptors, and is the specific subtype
          relevant to naloxone.
