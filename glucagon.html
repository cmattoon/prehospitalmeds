        <h2>GlucaGen</h2>
        <p>
          Glucagon is a peptide hormone produced naturally
          by the pancreas, and opposes insulin by increasing
          the levels of glucose in the bloodstream through
          glycogenolysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the prehospital environment, Glucagon is used
          as a second-line treatment for hypoglycemia, or
          as a first-line treatment when IV access is unavailable
          or difficult. Since it relies on metabolic stores of
          glycogen, Glucagon may not be effective in patients
          without adequate glycogen reserves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glucagon is administered via the intramuscular (IM)
          route and is available in both standard vials and
          autoinjectors.

        <h3>Mechanism of Action</h3>

        <p>
          <i class="fa fa-ambulance"></i>
          The pancreas releases glucagon naturally when the
          blood glucose level falls below a certain point.
          Glucagon travels to the liver and stimulates
          it to convert stored glycogen into glucose, thus
          increasing the blood glucose level.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i class="fa fa-heartbeat"></i>
          There is anecdotal evidence that glucagon is beneficial
          in <a href="http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/glucagon-as-an-antidote/">&beta;- and calcium-channel blocker overdose</a>.
          The suspected mechanism of action is twofold: first,
          there is some evidence that it works as a &beta;
          agonist, increasing inotropic and chronotropic
          effects within the myocardium.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i class="fa fa-hospital-o"></i>
          Glucagon also causes relaxation of the lower esophageal
          sphincter, which is occasionally useful in the
          (in-hospital) treatment of food stuck in the esophagus.

        <h3>Glycogenesis and Glycogenolysis</h3>

        <p>
          Understanding how the body processes glucose
          is necessary to understand how glucagon and
          <a href="dextrose.html">dextrose</a> work.
        </p>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Glycogenisis</strong> is the process of
              converting unused glucose into glycogen and storing
              it the liver and muscles for later use.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Glycogenolysis</strong> is the process of
              breaking down stored glycogen back into glucose
              when the body needs extra energy.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>
              <strong>Glycolysis</strong> is the metabolic pathway
              responsible for breaking down glucose into usable
              energy. First, glucose is broken down into two ATP
              molecules, two molecules of a coenzyme (NAD), and
              two molecules of pyruvate. The pyruvate is later
              processed during the Krebs cycle, and the overall
              process yields a total of 36 molecules of ATP for
              each molecule of glucose.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Gluconeogenesis</strong> is the opposite
              of glycolysis, and occurs when the body is starved
              of carbohydrates to convert. Gluconeogenesis uses
              many of the same chemical processes as glycolysis,
              but in reverse. Gluconeogenesis produces glucose
              by converting pyruvate into glucose.

            Severely hypoxic patients may take longer to
            respond to naloxone than usual. Since this is
            impossible to determine beforehand, it is important
            to support ventilation with a BVM attached to
            high-flow oxygen.
            <br><br>
            Proactive airway management is necessary due
            to the risk of vomiting post-administration.
            Since it's possible that the patient has taken
            other drugs that will not be affected by naloxone,
            it can't be assumed that the patient will be able
            to adequately protect their own airway.
            <br><br>
            While these patients rarely require intubation,
            it is not uncommon to place
            supraglottic/extraglottic airways (e.g., King LTD,
            Combitube) is sometimes required.

          <dt>Cardiovascular</dt>
          <dd>
            Opiates generally cause vasodilation and a
            decrease in blood pressure, causing a compensetory
            increase in heart rate. The reversal of these
            effects can compromise hemodynamic stability.
            Common side-effects include hypertension,
            hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia.
